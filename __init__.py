# Adapted for Anki 2.1 from Vitalie Spinu's Anki 2.0 add-on
#
# Binds 'j', 'h', 'k', 'l' to answer buttons. This allows the right hand to
# rest on the middle line of the keyboard. The rationale behind the choice of
# shortcuts is the following: fail / normal are the most common buttons (j, k)
# hard is fairly rare (in my usage) so it can be a bit out of the way in 'h'
# and easy is simply to the right of normal, 'l'. The original's add-on jkl;
# wasn't to my taste. As a bonus 'z' is bound to undo.
#
# Additionally, you can answer normal/easy on a failed card and it will do the
# right thing. You can also answer a card while in question state (which is
# convenient if you review tons of cards and need speed).
